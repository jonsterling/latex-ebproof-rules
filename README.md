The ebproof-rules package
===================

An extension of the `ebproof` package (Emmanuel Beffara) to support display of
inference rules within the `mathpar` environment provided by the `mathpartir`
package.


The following files are included:
- `ebproof-rules.dtx` : the doctrip source for the package and documentation
- `ebproof-rules.ins` : the generation script for producing `ebproof-rules.sty`

The package requires `expl3` (the LaTeX3 programming environment) which
provides many useful programming tools.

To build the documenation, run `l3build doc`.
